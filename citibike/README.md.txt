All assignments can be done in groups, but i strongly recommand you do this one in group  (5 ppl max) - brainstorming ideas works best if there are more then 1 brains!

For this Assignment I worked in a group of 3 people. My partners were 
Work on CitiBikes data https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data 
Come up with an idea of something that can be tested with a proportion, or mean problem, on the citibike data. 
I prepared an example here: 
https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2015_fbianco/blob/master/citibikes/citibikes_1950s.ipynb

Describe your idea
Turn the idea into a testable hypothesis and state your Null and alternative hypotheses
choose a confidence level
mangle your data as needed
choose a statistical test. Use e.g. z-score, or chi sq, but also other tests are available. Follow Statistics in a Nutshell to choose the appropriate test depending on your problem and on your data. 
assess whether you can reject the Null Hypothesis

Delivery: create a new Github directory called citibikes inside of your PUI2015_<your name> repo. I want you to do that because we will probably build on this exercise and work more tiwht the citibike data incrementally.
Deliver the exercise described above as a rendered notebook (75% grade on rendered version 25% on executable as for Assignments 1 and 2)
Include  a README.md in your repo that describes the project and states your specific contribution, instructions for the TA to run the notebook etc....

NOTE: the ipython notebooks can be identical if you work in the same group but the README.md must be individual, and it must state your specific contribution. be honest, and learn as much as ou can from the homework!
