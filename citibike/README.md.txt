For this Assignment, I worked in a group of 3 people. My partners were Erwan LeCun, Miyabi Ishihara. 

My Contributions:
I came up with the NULL Hypothesis. Erwan coded the z-test , I helped him with formulas and general reserach to do the code. I coded the Chi-Suqare Test on Python Notebook, miyabi helped me with formulas and to debug the code properly.  

IDEA:
Our group did both mean problem and a proportion problem using January 2015 citibike data. 
Z-test: 

Turn the idea into a testable hypothesis and state your Null and alternative hypotheses
choose a confidence level
mangle your data as needed
choose a statistical test. Use e.g. z-score, or chi sq, but also other tests are available. Follow Statistics in a Nutshell to choose the appropriate test depending on your problem and on your data. 
assess whether you can reject the Null Hypothesis

Delivery: create a new Github directory called citibikes inside of your PUI2015_<your name> repo. I want you to do that because we will probably build on this exercise and work more tiwht the citibike data incrementally.
Deliver the exercise described above as a rendered notebook (75% grade on rendered version 25% on executable as for Assignments 1 and 2)
Include  a README.md in your repo that describes the project and states your specific contribution, instructions for the TA to run the notebook etc....

NOTE: the ipython notebooks can be identical if you work in the same group but the README.md must be individual, and it must state your specific contribution. be honest, and learn as much as ou can from the homework!
