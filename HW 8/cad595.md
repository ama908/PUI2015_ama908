CLARITY: The plot is not very easy to read. Violin Plot is very uncommon plot and average audience will be confused by it. 

ESTHETIC: The plot color is appropriately chosen also meets the color blindess requirments. However the Y axis is missing the currency.Also some hashed lines appear in each distribution, which should be labelled with values, otherwise it doesn't communicate any information. There is  "industry_label.value" typed near the legend which should be taken out of the plot. The font size is correctly chosen. 

HONESTY: Yes the graph honestly delivers the data.
