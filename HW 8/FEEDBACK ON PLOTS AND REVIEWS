your comments are good and insightful 10/10


 NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
====================


the differences year by year are tiny so it is hard to understand why they are highlighted as they are by color: it is what draws most of the attention and it is not the message that tries to be conveyed. 

axis labels too small

the units on the y axis should be compresses: use tens of thousands and plot single digit numbers

colors are lost by the 10% of the population that is color blind that cannot tell the difference between 2007 and 2008 etc


NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===============================

cmprince
========
very nice and clear, despite the large amount of info displayed

the rainbow color scheme is never advised as it induces to see structure where there is none

the white label subscriber is hard to read

the yellow bins are good for separating the hour chunks but are not in the label leading to confusion

the 5 categories plotted as lines are actually 2 types of categories: they should be displayed with different lines (dashed and solid) and the line thickness generally adds to clutter but is not needed

missing y label at the top, but the title explains enough. maybe use smaller numbers by plotting in units of 10,000


carlyledavis
============
compact visualization that summarized a lot of the data structure. 

however there is a conceptual problem for this plot when it is used for a time series rather than categories. the reader is invariably given the impression that finance (blue here) lags behind in time w respect to the yellow category. this is the wrong (and in fact meaningless) impression but it is distracting.

y label ambiguous

what year are we referring to? include in title

a legend should tell whether the dotted and dashed lines are the mean or the median and the quirtiles or what else, though that can also be included in the caption. 


the mean (median?) would be better displayed as a solid line to further separate it from the quartiles (it woudl be hardin the caption to refer to the in words and disinguish them)

=========

missing axis labels

simpe display of time series, effective, no need for color since only 2 time series are shown and i like the simplicity of BW with different line styles. also nice that you removed the redundant axes: tufte complient.
