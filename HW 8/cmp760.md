CLARITY:  The plot contains too much information. The hourly plot has two diffenet bars but the legend is showing only one color. 
The Unknown legend seems to be unnecessary since its not visible on the plot.  Heat map is a bad way to represent the daily riderships, 
doesn’t communicate any information clearly, heat map labels shouldn’t be white. day of the months axis label is not clearly visible .


ESTHETIC: The plot doesn't meet colorblind requirment. The heatmap is distracting.

HONESTY: The heat map is not honestly delivering the data information. It seems that the Men Women and Subscriber has the same heat distribution. 
Although in reality they are quiet different, therefor putting the plots side by side is very misleading.
